Hey there! My name's Ana, I'm 25 years old, and my goal is to become a full-stack developer.

I've been studying since the beginning of the year, going through the basics, doing courses on my own and following the dev roadmap in order to get in the area as soon as I'm ready.

I’m currently learning JavaScript, JSX, React and Node.

I want to collaborate on that while I work on my projects.
